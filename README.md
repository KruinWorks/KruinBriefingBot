## How It Works
When received a `Update`, the bot will determine whether the source chat's type is channel or not.

If the source chat is a `Channel`, then check if this channel is in the KruinBriefing project.

If also, then forward the `Message` came up with the `Update` to the [@KruinBriefing](https://t.me/KruinBriefing) channel.
